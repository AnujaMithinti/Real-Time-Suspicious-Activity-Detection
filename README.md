# Real-Time-Suspicious-Activity-Detection
It is Suspicious activity detector in real time video this project can be used in many applications like Weapon Detection, Atm Crime Detection, Game Foul Detection etc.
This code integrates TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine Pose to create a real-time Suspicious recognition system using a webcam. It continuously captures frames, analyzes poses, and classifies them based on a pre-trained model. If suspicious activities (e.g., specific poses with high probability) are detected, it alerts the user by changing the displayed text and playing an alert sound. This setup could be used for various applications such as surveillance or interactive installations where real-time pose recognition is essential.
